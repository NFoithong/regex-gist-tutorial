# About the project
Create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

# User Story

SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

# Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
